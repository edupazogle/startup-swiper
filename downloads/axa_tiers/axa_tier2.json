    "description": "arterioscope is a medtech AI spin-off from Graz University of Technology developing digital biomarker diagnostics. Our patented technology non-invasively derives cardiac biomarkers — starting with NT-proBNP — directly from ECG and PPG signals processed by advanced machine learning models. NT-proBNP is the gold standard for heart failure diagnostics, but today requires costly and invasive blood tests. By leveraging data from a simple ECG or PPG, we enable earlier detection of heart failure, faster triage in primary care, and significant cost savings for healthcare providers and pharma. Beyond NT-proBNP, our platform is designed to expand to additional biomarkers — including renal function (eGFR) — creating the first scalable AI platform for digital biomarker diagnostics. We have proven our technology in clinical studies, secured pilot customers, and are now raising our seed round to bring the first AI-ECG biomarker product to market.",

    "description": "Wemates introduces an innovative P2P risk-sharing platform, which operates purely as a technical intermediary, adeptly connecting individuals seeking equitable and transparent insurance alternatives.\nIn essence, we’re building a P2P risk-sharing network where a group of individuals with mutual interests or similar risk profiles pool their “premiums” together to insure against a risk. Our platform enables individuals with similar interests to share the risk between themselves, whether based on shared interests, community ties, or specific needs. Often these individuals are somehow connected, e.g. personally (friends), or through mutual business or other common criteria (e.g. possession or similar interests). These groups are then free to define their terms, set coverage limits, and even manage claims. That significantly diverges from traditional insurance\nmodels by community-centric insurance ecosystem, utilizing decentralization and advanced technologies.",

Imagine writing an in-context learning prompt to an LLM with a few dozen examples.\n\nSuch specialized SLMs can solve specific tasks at much lower latency and cost than generic, pre-trained LLMs while maintaining accuracy. Additionally their small size allow for local deployment – leveraging the benefits of CPU inference (speed, cost, security, networking, reduced dependencies).\n\nOur hypothesis is that such small models will be the building blocks of highly performant multi-agentic AI products of the future.

    "description": "Hyphorest is a startup focused on connecting individuals and organizations to verified nature restoration projects, leveraging advanced satellite monitoring and AI technology. Their platform tracks CO₂ sequestration, biodiversity indicators, and ecosystem health to deliver transparent, third-party verified data. The company caters primarily to businesses seeking compliance-ready reporting for sustainability standards such as CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) and TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures), as well as individuals looking to make credible environmental contributions. Key offerings include selecting vetted restoration projects—such as reforestation, wetlands, mangroves, and regenerative agriculture—tracking impact through satellite data, and downloading annual compliance reports formatted for auditors and stakeholders. Hyphorest differentiates itself by eliminating greenwashing risks via continuous monitoring and providing data that goes beyond carbon metrics, supporting full nature-related disclosures. Their easy-to-use dashboard is tailored for corporate sustainability managers, simplifying adoption for teams without technical expertise in forestry or environmental sciences. The company also offers an October 2025 pilot program, allowing early participants to fund restoration projects and receive satellite-verified impact reports while positioning themselves as nature-positive leaders. Supported by ESA-BIC funding and led by experts in AI, machine learning, blockchain, and enterprise software, Hyphorest aims to revolutionize environmental impact tracking and reporting by making it transparent, actionable, and accessible to all stakeholders.",
