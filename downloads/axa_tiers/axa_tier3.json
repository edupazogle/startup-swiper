It develops a world-leading SaaS/on-prem platform used mainly for cybersecurity automation of (I)IoT device/firmware/software analysis (no source code required!), with particular focus on automated and AI-driven vulnerability management/analysis/mapping/tracking (CVEs and all that), SBOM recovery/generation/monitoring, software/components decay monitoring, software/components supply-chain analysis, and generally automated certification compliance (ETSI 303 645 and derivatives, UL 2900, ioXt, etc.) analysis/reporting. Moreover, the platform can also be used for traditional x86 software/firmware as well. The platform is successfully used in production in Global 2000 enterprises (excellently known brands worldwide) on several product lines (covering legacy, current, and next-generation) where those products have various PLC boards to control various industrial or industrial processes.",

    "description": "AI development in healthcare is held back by data privacy regulations, siloed datasets, and the lack of secure infrastructure for collaborative model training. Hospitals and companies cannot easily access diverse, real-world data without violating privacy laws.\n\nSA-FLaaS solves this by offering a secure and privacy-preserving federated learning platform, allowing organizations to train high-performing machine learning models without moving sensitive data.\n\nThe problem is massive: healthcare AI is a €100B+ global opportunity, but progress is blocked by data access and compliance issues. Our solution targets university hospitals, medical imaging companies, drug companies and diagnostics developers— all struggling to use AI at scale under strict data laws like GDPR and HIPAA.\n\nToday, these organizations spend millions on fragmented, in-house ML infrastructure or legal workarounds. With SA-FLaaS, they get a ready-made, compliant, and scalable environment — cutting cost, time, and risk.",

We offer a certified (MDR Class IIa/b) platform that uniquely integrates IV infusion therapy and vital signs monitoring (SpO₂, pulse, RR, CO₂), helping nurses detect issues before they escalate and reduce routine workload.\n\nUnlike traditional bedside monitors, our solution is mobile, easy to deploy, and designed for general hospital wards and home care—not just critical care. What sets us apart is our development of AI-powered algorithms that merge infusion and vital data to detect early signs of patient deterioration.\n\nTrusted in Finnish hospitals and now expanding globally, Monidor enhances care quality, supports better decisions, and saves resources. Our goal is to build a high-margin business with 70% recurring revenue and become the global RPM leader outside of critical care—starting with the Nordics, UK, and US.",

Its platform helps leaders improve their skills by delivering personalized feedback aligned with their company's values and team dynamics. Ogma addresses the shortcomings of traditional leadership training, which is often generic, expensive, and lacks real-time applicability. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) technology, Ogma analyzes conversation patterns, engagement levels, and subtle nuances such as tone and context. The AI then offers actionable guidance on areas like trust-building, psychological safety, active listening, and coaching mindset. Designed for managers at all experience levels, Ogma seamlessly integrates with popular video conferencing platforms and works unobtrusively during regular 1:1s. Key features include progress tracking, value-aligned growth, and balanced feedback, empowering leaders to continuously improve without disrupting workflows. The platform promotes measurable impact, with early users reporting increased confidence and stronger team connections. Notably, Ogma emphasizes privacy, ensuring all insights are constructive and focused on leadership growth rather than performance monitoring. By embedding leadership development into daily routines, Ogma enables organizations to foster resilient, high-performing teams while reinforcing their unique cultures and values.",

    "description": "TimeTeller is a spin-off from Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, leveraging circadian biology to optimize the timing of cancer treatments. Using a simple, saliva test, we generate a personalized profile of each patient’s internal biological clock to align therapy with their optimal treatment window. This approach can significantly reduce side effects and enhance efficacy and is already being validated in clinical studies at over 10 hospitals. Our patent-protected technology is built on cutting-edge research in oncology and chronobiology. Our goal: to revolutionize cancer care by making treatment not only more effective, but also more humane. Our current focus is oncology, because, every year, more than 19 million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer. But our potential extends far beyond that. We have studies in Parkinson’s, women’s health, sports, and longevity. We want to become a global player in cancer therapy and personalized medicine with a European innovation.",

When employees use ChatGPT, Claude, or any LLM, we automatically detect and anonymize sensitive data before it leaves your infrastructure - preventing customer data, IP, and business secrets from reaching external AI providers.\nOrganizations gain complete visibility: who's using which tools, what data is shared, risk levels per interaction, and automatic audit trails. Administrators deploy pre-configured compliance modules (GDPR, EU AI Act, ISO, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that enforce protection across all AI services based on industry requirements.\nWe provide compliance proof, not compliance software. Every AI interaction is logged with context: team member, purpose, risk level, and data handling. When auditors ask \"how do you manage AI risk?\" you have documentation ready. Built for organizations handling sensitive information - regulated industries (government, finance, healthcare, legal) and companies serving enterprise clients.",

At its core is a knowledge graph + autonomous agent: the graph eliminates hallucinations and keeps training always current, while the agent with memory and task logic designs entire courses, adapts content to each learner, and updates materials automatically whenever source knowledge changes.\n\n Foxtery requires no migration, integrates seamlessly through SCORM, and delivers measurable business impact: zero time spent on course creation, maximized engagement through interactive dialogues, and direct closure of knowledge gaps that accelerate growth.\n\nWe’re not just improving training — we’re creating the foundation for hybrid human-AI teams where people and digital agents learn from the same source of truth.",

These reports highlight likely triggers and provide evidence based strategies to mitigate symptoms, giving users practical insights and clearer control over their health.\n\nOur methodology of leveraging user data, curated academic data and environmental data through AI allows us to provide users with insights previously out of reach to themselves and their medical practitioner.

The platform automatically surfaces and documents risks you didn’t know were there into a live, audit-ready report. This is enabled through the company’s proprietary integration platform that allows banks to unify fragmented data into a virtual knowledge graph.\n\nBy connecting data points across transactions, customers, and counterparties, Convier gives investigators the full picture behind every risk signal. Instead of chasing false positives, compliance teams can focus on meaningful alerts enriched with real-world context. The result is faster investigations, stronger regulatory defensibility, and a significant reduction in manual workload.\n\nConvier is trusted by 13 Nordic banks to automate their compliance reporting.

Developers keep their IDE and tools; we remove setup friction and align assistants with how your company builds software. Out of the box, agents gain safe access to the org’s services and act within policy, so drafts and actions come out on-strategy without extra portals or process. Teams converge on repeatable habits, rework drops, cycle time improves, and leaders can see where AI is helping—by repo and team—so investment and guardrails can be tuned with evidence. In short: from isolated experiments to standard practice, with less cognitive load for developers and measurable, policy-aware adoption for the organization.",

DARA’s integrated Skills—ThreatFinder, ThreatSimulator, PolicyPilot and Impact Analysis—work as one virtual CISO. Siemens Healthineers uses ThreatSimulator to support regulatory cybersecurity reviews and speed product release. Early results: ~40% of product (OT) vulnerabilities are assessed automatically; the remaining ~60% get step-by-step guidance, reducing workload ~60%. Outputs are regulator-ready in VEX. ThreatFinder also cuts triage by ~40% and predicts exploitability ~4× better than EPSS. Delivered as API-first SaaS or white-label, DARA helps CISOs anticipate threats, prioritise mitigation and prove compliance, and is already embedded by cybersecurity vendors.",

Today, it takes weeks (up to 18 months in Italy!) for a geneticist to get the results of genomic analysis from a few specialized bioinformatics centers. This significantly slows down R&D and clinical diagnostics.\n\nGenoGra provides a user-friendly platform for bioinformaticians to run advanced pan-genomic analyses with ease. While pan-genomics ensures top accuracy, it is computationally demanding and slow.\u000bGenoGra’s patented technology leverages GPUs to accelerate these algorithms, delivering optimal quality and outstanding speed. This allows bioinformaticians to finally focus on optimizing applications and driving research, rather than building workflows and trying to balance accuracy and speed - actionable genomic knowledge in days rather than weeks!\n\n",

    "description": "Rentzzy builds the infrastructure that enables businesses to monetize idle assets through verified rentals. The platform connects SMEs with users and other companies, allowing them to safely rent out underused inventory instead of keeping it idle. Each business can create a verified shop, define pricing, policies, and deposits, and start earning recurring revenue through secure payments, insurance, and automated payouts.\n\nBy replacing ownership with access, Rentzzy increases asset utilization, improves capital efficiency, and drives measurable circular impact. Businesses gain new recurring revenue streams, while users and companies access high-quality assets without the burden of ownership.\n\nLaunching across four EU markets in early 2026, Rentzzy operates at the intersection of the circular economy and fintech infrastructure, integrating logistics, insurance, and verification partners to scale a trusted, revenue-generating access network.",

    "description": "We are reimagining language learning by leveraging the world’s most translated text as a universal linguistic anchor. Our framework turns language acquisition into a narrative-based journey that begins with content millions already understand, reducing cognitive load and accelerating early comprehension. By aligning parallel translations across hundreds of languages, learners intuitively map vocabulary, grammar, and semantics through meaningful context rather than rote memorization.\n\nBuilt for global accessibility, our approach works even in regions with low digital infrastructure, and easily scales across cultures, dialects, and orthographies. Beyond proficiency, our goal is to help learners internalize language until it becomes automatic—unlocking deeper communication, cultural empathy, and long-term learning behavior. Ultimately, we aim to transform language education into an intuitive, story-driven experience that fosters real global understanding.",

    "description": "WasteSide is a gamified sustainability platform that engages students in universities across Germany. Through interactive challenges and rewards, students are encouraged to adopt environmentally friendly behaviors in their daily lives – from reducing waste to choosing sustainable mobility. The platform not only drives measurable ecological impact, but also creates a new channel for companies: they can become visible at the campus, sponsor challenges or rewards, and showcase themselves as attractive employers to a young, impact-driven audience. With already more than 7,000 registered users and over 60,000 completed challenges, WasteSide proves that gamification is a powerful tool to change behavior. For students, it means fun, community, and tangible incentives; for companies, it is authentic employer branding and direct recruiting; and for society, it contributes to climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals. WasteSide thus bridges sustainability, technology, and talents.",

    "description": "Vizaible helps brands understand and improve how Generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity perceive them. As AI replaces traditional search, most companies have become invisible — their products, claims, and differentiators are not recalled by large language models. Vizaible solves this through a full Generative-Engine Optimization (GEO) stack: it audits a brand’s visibility across major AIs, identifies claim gaps between what the company says and what AIs remember, and then activates structured microsites, schema, and FAQs that feed correct data back into the AI ecosystem. The platform also tracks visibility evolution, authority, and recall performance over time. Powered by a tokenized credit economy, every audit and activation fuels both monetization and network growth. In short, Vizaible turns AI perception into a measurable, fixable, and monetizable business asset.",

We are developing a compact optical sensing platform for in-line measurement of refractive index, concentration, and temperature in small-volume and smart liquid systems. Existing solutions are bulky, expensive, or require off-line sampling, limiting efficiency and increasing waste in (bio)chemical, pharmaceutical, and food & beverage sectors. Firefly overcomes these barriers by combining nanophotonic technology with a simple, low-cost optical readout unit, delivering high-precision insights faster and more easily. Firefly Sensing empowers industries to work cleaner, faster, and more intelligently.",

    "description": "Tweaq is redefining how teams ensure software quality in an era of AI-generated code. While planning, design, and development are supported by powerful tools, QA remains the most manual, fragmented stage of the product lifecycle; and as AI starts writing code, the problem is only growing. Tweaq solves this by giving teams a single environment where humans and agents can review, test, and improve live software together.\n\nBy capturing every edit and comment as structured data, Tweaq automatically generates pull requests or tickets, bridging the gap between feedback and implementation. This transforms QA from a bottleneck into a scalable, collaborative process that accelerates delivery across the entire product team.\n\nBuilt for a future where most code is agent-written, Tweaq becomes the control layer for software quality, empowering teams to ship faster, with confidence and clarity.",

We train the people who'll decide where trillions flow and which breakthrough innovations get built: GPs, LPs, family offices, corporate innovation chiefs, and research commercialization leaders. Better decisions. Better world.\n\nThe venture industry has an education problem. Traditional programs teach reporting, spreadsheets, and term sheets. We teach what actually matters: deep tech evaluation, sustainability that creates real impact, future scenario planning, and the courage to back innovations others dismiss as impossible.\n\nOur graduates won't think like today's investors.

Our patented technology enables a significantly higher concentration of the medication to reach the airways, making inhalation therapy more effective and thus targeting a reduction in mortality rates and hospital stays.\n\nFirst use case is preterm infants with BPD:\nThe greatest danger comes from their underdeveloped lungs. Current treatment options are fundamentally inadequate. We offer the missing link: an inhalation-based therapy that overcomes the dilution problem in the ventilatory circuit, overcoming the inefficiencies of current methods. \nA clinical PoC study with 40 preterm infants is scheduled to start in mid-2026.\n\nSecond: adults with COPD and Asthma.\nOur technology is directly scalable for adults. \n\nThird: surfactant application for preterm infants",

Yet most remain undiscovered or underused because microbial data is fragmented, incomplete, and locked away in isolated collections. Strain Vaults is building the world’s most advanced microbial biobank to change that.\nUsing our AI engine, Omni-AI, we scan each bacterium’s genetic code to predict its industrial potential, identifying microbes that outperform existing strains in applications like enzyme production, drug discovery, and bioremediation.

    "description": "Demp Bio is a startup specializing in the production of natural, biodegradable acoustic panels crafted from mycelium and Norwegian wood waste. These innovative panels are designed to provide sustainable soundproofing solutions while maintaining a strong commitment to environmental responsibility. The company leverages biotechnology and design to develop acoustic solutions that align with future demands for eco-friendly products. Demp Bio's approach highlights the use of mycelium, a fungal material known for its insulating and sound-absorbing properties, paired with locally sourced wood waste, creating a product that is both functional and sustainable.

    "description": "C12 Quantum Electronics is a Paris-based startup focused on reimagining quantum hardware architecture. The company's core mission is \"to power the next revolution in computing by reimagining how quantum hardware is built,\" addressing fundamental hardware-level challenges in quantum computing technology. Rather than using traditional quantum computing materials, C12 leverages carbon nanotubes—described as \"the simplest material\"—combined with semiconductor manufacturing principles. This approach enables a scalable platform that bridges ultra-pure materials with existing manufacturing expertise. The company positions this as analogous to silicon's role in classical computing. C12 offers Callisto, a quantum emulator supporting circuits up to 13 qubits. The Discovery edition is currently available as a free cloud-based tool, allowing developers to test quantum algorithms before running them on physical hardware. The company demonstrates strong institutional backing through partnerships with premier research organizations (École Normale Supérieure, CEA-LETI, Argonne Lab), industry leaders (Atos, Air Liquide, OVHcloud), and investors including Varsity, Verve Ventures, and EIC. Public funding comes from major French initiatives. By addressing quantum computing's fundamental error problem through hardware innovation rather than incremental improvements, C12 positions itself as enabling the next computational leap while leveraging scalable manufacturing infrastructure.",

    "description": "DURI is a rice-based food tech company rewriting the future of functional nutrition through biotechnology and clean innovation. Our mission is to detoxify the global food chain from how grains are grown and processed to how bodies metabolize them.\nOur proprietary platform combines agricultural science, food processing, and biochemistry to address heavy-metal exposure at every stage:\n1) Lowering toxic element absorption in grains through optimized cultivation practices.\n2) Developing food-tech methods that reduce or remove heavy metals during processing.\n3) Formulating functional supplements and foods that help the body safely chelate and release accumulated heavy metals.\nThrough our flagship brand BARI, DURI first entered the baby nutrition category while meeting the world’s strictest safety standards. Our broader research extends to functional beverages, adult nutrition, and preventive supplements designed to restore internal balance from the ground up.",

Assumptions made by AI, or even humans, turn exponentially wrong as complexity increases.\n\nAt Automata, we saw how in nature, solutions to complex problems emerge from order, with just tiny bits of wisdom. So we started to build something totally different from existing software engineering paradigms. \n\nA system that doesn't assume wisdom from user or LLM turned out to work. For months, we've used Automata to develop even Automata itself, among other commercial projects. Today, 64% of specifications and 98% of code passes strict requirements without human intervention.",

Our STELION ecosystem includes plug-and-play hydrogen storage capsules, decentralized refueling stations, and hybrid fuel cell systems that replace conventional batteries in vehicles, UAVs, and industrial machinery. Our technology enables decentralized hydrogen distribution, allowing delivery from a single production point to multiple consumers, eliminating dependency on large-scale infrastructure that still does not exist. By removing the need for high-pressure hoses and costly refrigeration systems, we reduce hydrogen station CAPEX by 28% and compression requirements by 30%, enabling efficient, fast, and safe refueling anywhere.",
