# AXA Grading System - Example Evaluations

This document provides concrete examples of how startups are graded using the new A+ to F system.

---

## Example 1: European Agentic Platform (Grade: A)

### Startup Profile
```
Name: Cognita
Country: Finland (EU Extended)
Maturity: Scaling (deployed to customers)
Funding Stage: Pre-Series A / Bootstrapped
Total Funding: ~$0
Primary Topic: Topic 1 (Agentic)
Use Cases: Agentic automation, autonomous workflows
Provider Status: Yes (actively deployed at enterprises)
```

### Evaluation Breakdown

| Component | Score | Max | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Market Fit** | 0/25 | ❌ | No external funding despite strong market traction - pre-Series A, bootstrapped |
| **Scalability** | 5/25 | ⚠️ | Early scaling phase, single main use case deployment |
| **Innovation** | 24/25 | ✅ | Topic 1 (Agentic) - highest AI capability category |
| **Financial Health** | 0/25 | ❌ | No external funding - significant risk factor |
| **Corporate Experience** | 18/20 | ✅ | Already deployed at multiple enterprises (provider status) |
| **Use Case Breadth** | 8/20 | ⚠️ | Focused use case, limited to agentic automation domain |
| **Geographic Fit** | 17/20 | ✅ | Finland (EU Extended) - good GDPR/data compliance |
| **Risk Penalties** | -8 | ❌ | No external funding is significant risk (-8 pts) |

### Scoring
```
Raw Score: 72/160 points
Normalized: 45/100
Grade: C- (Weak)
Tier: Tier 4 (Low Priority)
```

### Interpretation
**Why C- despite great innovation and enterprise traction?**

Cognita is a classic case of a great product with the wrong financial profile for AXA partnership. Key insights:

1. **Strengths**:
   - Topic 1 (Agentic) - this is the most innovative AI capability
   - Already used by multiple enterprises - proves product-market fit and implementation capability
   - EU-based with good GDPR compliance

2. **Critical Weakness**:
   - **No external funding** is a major red flag - either market isn't convinced yet, or founders are intentionally bootstrapping
   - This is worth -8 points, dragging an otherwise decent score down by 5+ percentage points
   - For AXA partnership, we need confidence in the company's ability to scale and commit resources

3. **Limited Scope**:
   - Single use case (agentic automation) limits partnership flexibility
   - Would need to be embedded into only one business unit

### Partnership Recommendation
❌ **Not suitable right now** - revisit in 12 months if:
- Raises Series A funding (proves market confidence)
- Expands to 2-3 use cases
- Grows enterprise customer base to 5+ customers

If those happen, could become A- or B+ grade.

## Example 2: US-Based Growth-Stage AI (Grade: B)

### Startup Profile
```
Name: ClaimsAI  
Country: United States
Maturity: Growth (expanding customer base)
Funding Stage: Series A ($4M raised)
Total Funding: $4,000,000
Primary Topic: Topic 3 (Claims Processing)
Use Cases: Claims triage, fraud detection
Provider Status: Yes (3 insurance companies)
```

### Evaluation Breakdown

| Component | Score | Max | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Market Fit** | 12/25 | ⚠️ | Series A funding + modest amount shows some market validation |
| **Scalability** | 17/25 | ✅ | Growth stage + 2 use cases shows platform potential |
| **Innovation** | 20/25 | ✅ | Topic 3 (Claims) - strong AI focus on insurance-specific problem |
| **Financial Health** | 8/25 | ⚠️ | Series A stage with $4M - modest but sufficient runway |
| **Corporate Experience** | 8/20 | ⚠️ | 3 insurance customers shows enterprise traction, but not proven at scale |
| **Use Case Breadth** | 8/20 | ⚠️ | Exactly 2 use cases - claims triage and fraud detection |
| **Geographic Fit** | 8/20 | ❌ | US-based - acceptable but not EU advantage |
| **Risk Penalties** | 0 | ✅ | Growth stage + proper funding = no major risk penalties |

### Scoring
```
Raw Score: 81/160 points
Normalized: 50.6/100
Grade: B (Acceptable)
Tier: Tier 2 (High Priority)
```

### Interpretation
**Why B - a good but not great fit?**

ClaimsAI is a solid partnership candidate with good execution and reasonable market fit, but limitations:

1. **Strengths**:
   - Topic 3 (Claims) is highly relevant to AXA's core business
   - Series A funding + $4M shows investor confidence
   - Already deployed at 3 insurance companies (proves they can implement)
   - 2 use cases demonstrates platform thinking

2. **Limitations**:
   - **US location** creates GDPR/data compliance challenges (8/20 vs 20/20 for EU)
   - Series A stage means product is still maturing
   - Only 3 customer references (want 5+)
   - Focused on claims (limited to one business unit)

3. **Implementation Readiness**:
   - Good - they've proven implementation
   - But would need customization for AXA's specific claims process

### Partnership Recommendation
✅ **Evaluate for partnership** - specifically for:
- Claims processing automation
- Fraud detection in claims
- Could become A- or B+ if they:
  - Expand to 3+ use cases (underwriting, medical networks)
  - Grow customer base to 5-7 insurance companies
  - Raise Series B (proves continued confidence)

**Timeline**: Schedule partnership discussion within 6 months.

## Example 3: German Late-Stage Insurance Tech (Grade: A)

### Startup Profile
```
Name: InsureFlow
Country: Germany (EU Core)

Primary Topic: Topic 1 (Agentic) + Topic 4 (Underwriting)
Use Cases: Agentic underwriting, policy automation, claims routing, customer service
Provider Status: Yes (major insurance companies: Allianz, Munich Re, Generali)
```

### Evaluation Breakdown

| Component | Score | Max | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Market Fit** | 19/25 | ✅ | Series C + $25M funding = strong market validation |
| **Scalability** | 23/25 | ✅ | Scaling stage + 4 use cases = proven platform scalability |
| **Innovation** | 24/25 | ✅ | Topic 1 (Agentic) - cutting edge AI capability |
| **Financial Health** | 22/25 | ✅ | Series C - significant runway, investor confidence |
| **Corporate Experience** | 20/20 | ✅ | Used by Allianz, Munich Re, Generali - major enterprises |
| **Use Case Breadth** | 17/20 | ✅ | 4 distinct use cases (underwriting, automation, claims, service) |
| **Geographic Fit** | 20/20 | ✅ | Germany - EU Core, optimal GDPR/compliance position |
| **Risk Penalties** | 0 | ✅ | Scaling stage + proper funding = low risk |

### Scoring
```
Raw Score: 145/160 points
Normalized: 90.6/100
Grade: A (Excellent)
Tier: Tier 1 (Critical Priority)
```

### Interpretation
**Why A - the ideal AXA partner?**

InsureFlow represents everything AXA should be pursuing:

1. **Core Strengths**:
   - **Agentic AI (Topic 1)** - cutting-edge autonomous agent technology
   - **Scaling maturity** - proven ability to deploy at major enterprises
   - **Series C funding** - well-funded, proven investor confidence
   - **EU Core location** - Germany provides data/compliance advantages
   - **Major customer references** - Allianz, Munich Re, Generali are peers
   - **Multiple use cases** - can address claims, underwriting, service, automation

2. **Why Not A+?**:
   - Only 4 use cases identified (5+ would be A+)
   - Could have more geographic expansion
   - Could have slightly more enterprise references

3. **Partnership Ready**:
   - Immediately ready for strategic partnership discussion
   - Can implement across multiple business units
   - No execution risk

### Partnership Recommendation
✅✅ **PURSUE IMMEDIATELY** for partnership across:
- Agentic underwriting automation
- Claims processing workflow
- Customer service routing
- Policy administration

**Action Items**:
1. Schedule C-level partnership discussion within 2 weeks
2. Explore multi-year integration commitment
3. Consider minority investment or revenue share
4. Plan pilot program for 2-3 use cases in Q1

## Example 4: Early-Stage Deep Tech (Grade: C)

### Startup Profile
```
Name: QuantumAI
Country: South Korea
Maturity: Validating (proof of concept)
Funding Stage: Seed ($500K raised)
Total Funding: $500,000
Primary Topic: Topic 10 (DeepTech)
Use Cases: Advanced machine learning research
Provider Status: No (no customer implementations)
```

### Evaluation Breakdown

| Component | Score | Max | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Market Fit** | 4/25 | ❌ | Seed stage + small funding shows early validation |
| **Scalability** | 2/25 | ❌ | Prototype/research phase, no scalability proof |
| **Innovation** | 5/25 | ❌ | Topic 10 (DeepTech) - research, not insurance-focused |
| **Financial Health** | 2/25 | ❌ | Seed stage only, limited runway |
| **Corporate Experience** | 0/20 | ❌ | No enterprise customers, no implementation proof |
| **Use Case Breadth** | 0/20 | ❌ | Research-focused, no defined business use cases |
| **Geographic Fit** | 5/20 | ❌ | South Korea - data compliance challenges |
| **Risk Penalties** | -13 | ❌ | Prototype stage (-5), seed funding (-8) |

### Scoring
```
Raw Score: 18/160 points
Normalized: 11.3/100
Grade: C (Limited)
Tier: Tier 4 (Low Priority)
```

### Interpretation
**Why C - too early for AXA?**

QuantumAI is an interesting research company, but fundamentally not ready for enterprise partnership:

1. **Fundamental Issues**:
   - **Prototype stage** - product doesn't have product-market fit yet
   - **No customers** - no proof of implementation capability
   - **Non-insurance focused** - deep tech, not solving AXA problems
   - **South Korea location** - data transfer and compliance concerns

2. **Even Innovation Doesn't Help**:
   - Topic 10 (DeepTech) is research-focused
   - Doesn't have the insurance-specific AI focus (Topics 1-5)
   - AXA can't partner on research without business application

3. **Why Not Lower?**:
   - (Not D/F because the technology could be valuable in 18 months)

### Partnership Recommendation
❌ **Not suitable now** - revisit in 18-24 months if:
- Raises Series A ($5M+)
- Pivots to insurance-specific use case
- Proves customer traction (even 1-2 customers)
- Moves operations to EU for data compliance

**Current Action**: Add to monitoring list, contact annually for updates.

## Grade Distribution Pattern

In a healthy portfolio of 100-200 evaluated startups, expect this distribution:

```
A+ :  2-5%  (exceptional startups, pursue actively)
A  :  5-8%  (excellent startups, high priority)
A- : 10-15% (very good startups, evaluate for fit)
B+ : 15-20% (good startups, good candidates)
B  : 15-20% (acceptable startups, consider for specific use cases)
B- : 12-18% (marginal, revisit in 12 months)
C+ :  8-12% (early stage, monitoring)
C  :  5-8%  (not suitable now)
C- :  2-5%  (weak candidates)
D  :  1-2%  (poor fit)
F  :  1%    (unsuitable)
```

This distribution shows:
- 22-28% are A/A+/A- (pursue actively)
- 42-58% are B tier (good evaluation candidates)
- 15-25% are C tier (monitor or revisit)
- 2-3% are D/F (not suitable)

---

## Key Takeaways

### Use Grades to Make Decisions

- **A/A+ grades** → Call for partnership meeting
- **B+ / B grades** → Evaluate fit for specific business units
- **B- / C+ grades** → Annual monitoring, revisit if company raises funding
- **C / C- grades** → Not suitable, don't pursue
- **D / F grades** → Not suitable, no meaningful partnership potential

### Grades Are Transparent

Each grade has explicit reasoning showing:
- Which components are strong (✅)
- Which are weak (❌)
- What would improve the grade

### Grades Reflect AXA's Priorities

- **EU location** = 20/20 geographic points
- **Agentic AI** = 24/25 innovation points
- **Enterprise customers** = 18/20 corporate experience points
- **Funding** = critical risk factor (missing funding = -8 points)

### Grades Change Over Time

A C-grade startup becomes B+ or A- if they:
- Raise Series B funding
- Expand to 3+ use cases
- Grow customer base to 5+ enterprises
- Move operations to EU

Monitor quarterly and re-grade as company evolves.
