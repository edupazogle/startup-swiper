However, conventional SAPs are non-biodegradable and face major regulatory pressure, including a 2028 EU ban on their use in soils. Our technology uses sustainable chemistry pathways to create high-performance, cost-competitive SAPs that meet both regulatory and consumer demand for sustainable products.

Our platform enables individuals with similar interests to share the risk between themselves, whether based on shared interests, community ties, or specific needs. Often these individuals are somehow connected, e.g. personally (friends), or through mutual business or other common criteria (e.g. possession or similar interests). These groups are then free to define their terms, set coverage limits, and even manage claims. That significantly diverges from traditional insurance\nmodels by community-centric insurance ecosystem, utilizing decentralization and advanced technologies.","founding_year":2018,"primary_industry":"fintech","secondary_industry":"[\"ai\", \"socialImpact\"]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2c\", \"b2b\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/23cdcc57-34cd-4726-976a-50b6f3209446"},{"company_name":"ROKA FURADADA","company_type":"startup","company_country":"ES","company_city":"Spain","website":"https://www.rokafuradada.com/","company_linked_in":"https://es.linkedin.com/company/rokafuradada","company_description":"Roka Furadada develops and produces innovative active ingredients designed to prevent skin cancer and other UV-related skin conditions, using deep-tech research to create solutions that are both highly effective and environmentally safe.

Faster compliance, lower operational burden, and actual emissions reductions and cost savings.","founding_year":2022,"primary_industry":"deeptech","secondary_industry":"[\"climate\", \"manufacturingMaterials\"]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2b\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"prominent_investors":"Remarkable Ventures, Closed Loop Partners, Regeneration.VC, Scania, Prequel Ventures, Cambridge Enterprise","profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/c6b65817-3d75-49d5-9788-a507785a8bd0"},{"company_name":"ReceiptHero","company_type":"startup","company_country":"FI","company_city":"Tampere","website":"https://getreceipthero.com/","company_linked_in":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/receipthero/","company_description":"ReceiptHero takes the concept of digital receipts further, supporting sustainable habits by reducing paper use, protecting consumer privacy, and responsibly using receipt data to provide value back to our users and their chosen retailers.\n","founding_year":2019,"primary_industry":"fintech","secondary_industry":"[\"fintech\", \"onlineMarkets\"]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2b\", \"b2g\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"prominent_investors":"Lifeline Ventures, Superhero Capital, Vidici Ventures, SeedX","profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/a7eefb21-b175-4af7-b68b-168253200f3d"},{"company_name":"NABAT","company_type":"startup","company_country":"AE","company_city":"ABU DHABI","website":"https://www.nabat.ai","company_linked_in":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nabatai/","company_description":"Build technologies to enable scalable and precise ecosystem management (including ecosystem assessment, ecosystem reforestation and ecosystem MRV - monitoring, reporting and verification)","founding_year":2024,"primary_industry":"climate","secondary_industry":"[\"ai\"]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2b\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/584c12db-7133-46cc-aa68-8e8c45234566"},{"company_name":"Doublepoint","company_type":"startup","company_country":"FI","company_city":"Helsinki","website":"https://www.doublepoint.com/","company_linked_in":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/doublepointlab/","company_description":"Doublepoint is dedicated to building interactions for next-generation interfaces.

Our drop-in billing gateway—just swap your OpenAI/Anthropic base URL and add OAuth—meters each token in real time, builds a wallet for every user, and blocks calls when unfunded. End-users top up with cards, bring their own API keys, or redeem promo credits you seed; you can overlay a custom transaction margin that flows straight to your developer wallet, making free trials cost-neutral and early usage profitable.\n\nRevenue comes from (1) per-credit markup, (2) tiered SaaS plans for larger teams, and (3) custom enterprise agreements. Next on the roadmap are token-efficiency analytics and automated prompt-minimization tools, helping builders cut LLM spend before it even hits the wallet.\n\nResult: any solo founder or SaaS team can launch AI features safely, validate demand, and scale without going broke.","founding_year":2025,"primary_industry":"ai","secondary_industry":"[\"analytics\"]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2b\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/94cdf535-830a-44b0-83a5-858ef48115b9"},{"company_name":"Amiko","company_type":"startup","company_country":"FI","company_city":"Helsinki","website":"","company_linked_in":"","company_description":"Amiko is a customer-first pet care brand that combines accessible neighbourhood clinics with a digital platform to deliver lifelong, holistic care for pets.","founding_year":2025,"primary_industry":"somethingElse","secondary_industry":"[]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2c\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/46234f86-e619-420a-bf04-78eacc515a2b"},{"company_name":"Remolab","company_type":"startup","company_country":"FR","company_city":"Paris","website":"https://Remolab.fr","company_linked_in":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/remolab","company_description":"Remolab is a FinTech-focused startup studio based in France, dedicated to building and fast-tracking disruptive ventures with the goal of quick exits through acquisition.

We are now leveraging that RF and manufacturing track record to build scalable, 5G/NTN-ready SOS patches and connected fabrics for safety, logistics and industrial IoT.","founding_year":2014,"primary_industry":"somethingElse","secondary_industry":"[\"comms\", \"propConstruction\", \"wearables\", \"somethingElse\", \"sports\", \"robo\", \"mobility\", \"deeptech\", \"dualUseTech\", \"clothingFashion\"]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2b\", \"b2c\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/3b1b46b8-8116-4a1d-adb0-d005d4b6218a"},{"company_name":"Cellknit Inc.","company_type":"startup","company_country":"KR","company_city":"Pohang","website":"","company_linked_in":"","company_description":"Sell bioimplant product to cell therapeutic companies and hospitals","founding_year":2024,"primary_industry":"biotech","secondary_industry":"[\"deeptech\"]","focus_industries":null,"business_types":"[\"b2b\"]","curated_collections_tags":null,"profile_link":"https://platform.slush.org/slush25/meeting-tool/browse/companies/a68ee89e-0bc8-4744-92e4-4a181012f4ff"},{"company_name":"Zeabuz","company_type":"startup","company_country":"NO","company_city":"Trondheim","website":"https://www.zeabuz.com/","company_linked_in":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/zeabuz/mycompany/","company_description":"Zeabuz's technology is based on decades of applied and cutting-edge research on maritime autonomy at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

Unlike ponds or bulky reactors, our system is compact, efficient, and scalable—production expands by simply adding more units, enabling flexible deployment close to demand. Each module operates as a precision-controlled “black box,” managing light, water, CO₂, and nutrients for optimal yields. This adaptability unlocks applications in aquaculture, nutraceuticals, pigments, protein, sustainable fuels, and CO₂ capture. Beyond hardware, our roadmap integrates AI-driven automation to turn biological variability into predictable, profitable output. Through our Algae-as-a-Service model, we provide clients with training, protocols, and ongoing support, making cultivation accessible to any operator.
