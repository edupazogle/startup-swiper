# AXA Startup Selection Rules - Clarified Definitions

## Core Principle
**Evaluate startups based on their PRIMARY, CORE business offering - NOT what they could theoretically enable or support.**

## How to Apply Rules

### ❌ WRONG Approach
- Pandatron enables agentic platform → Mark as Rule 1
- Bankify could help with financial processes → Mark as Rule 2.5

### ✅ CORRECT Approach  
- Pandatron's core business is [What they sell/do] → Match to appropriate rule
- Bankify's core business is consumer banking app → Not a B2B provider for AXA

## Classification Logic

### Step 1: Identify Core Business
What does this startup primarily SELL?
- What is their main product/service?
- What do they market themselves as?
- Who are their primary customers?

### Step 2: Match to ONE Primary Rule
Each startup should map to ONE primary rule:
- Rule 1: They sell AI/agent infrastructure
- Rule 2: They sell enterprise business solutions
- Rule 3: They sell insurance-specific tools
- Rule 4: They sell health tech with insurance applicability
- Rule 5: They sell development/modernization tools

### Step 3: Identify Categories Within Rule
Within the primary rule, identify relevant categories:
- A claims automation startup → Rule 3, Category F3.1
- A marketing automation SaaS → Rule 2, Category F2.1
- An LLM monitoring tool → Rule 1, Category F1.1

### Step 4: Can AXA Use as Provider?
- ✅ TRUE: If AXA can buy/subscribe to their core product
- ❌ FALSE: If B2C only, marketplace, competitor, or irrelevant domain

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: "Enables" vs "Sells"
- **Wrong**: Pandatron uses agents → Rule 1
- **Right**: What does Pandatron SELL? → Classify based on that

### ❌ Mistake 2: Theoretical Use Cases
- **Wrong**: This tool could be used for marketing → Rule 2.1
- **Right**: Is marketing their core business offering? → If no, don't mark it

### ❌ Mistake 3: Multiple Primary Rules
- **Wrong**: Matches Rule 1, 2, and 5
- **Right**: Pick ONE primary rule based on core business

### ❌ Mistake 4: B2C Marked as Provider
- **Wrong**: Consumer app that uses AI → Provider = true
- **Right**: B2C only → Provider = false

### ❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring Core Value Proposition
- **Wrong**: Has API integration capability → Rule 5.4
- **Right**: Is integration their core product? → If no, don't mark it

## Validation Checklist

Before marking a feature/rule:
- [ ] Is this the startup's CORE, PRIMARY business offering?
- [ ] Do they actively SELL/MARKET this capability?
- [ ] Is this how they describe themselves?
- [ ] Is this how they generate revenue?
- [ ] Can AXA engage as a B2B customer for this core offering?

If answering "NO" to any of the above, DO NOT mark that feature/rule.
