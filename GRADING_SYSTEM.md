# AXA Startup Grading System (A+ to F)

## Overview

The AXA Startup Grading System replaces numeric scores (0-100) with realistic letter grades (A+ to F) that evaluate startups based on their potential to deliver value to AXA through partnerships, integrations, and strategic collaborations.

**Design Philosophy**: Grades reflect partnership quality and implementation potential, not just technical merit or market size. An A+ startup is a **scaling platform with proven market fit, strong funding, EU presence, multiple use cases, and leading AI/agentic capabilities** - exactly what AXA needs.

## Evaluation Criteria (160 total points)

### 1. Market Fit (0-25 points)
Evaluates proof of market demand and customer traction.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Funding as validation**: 
  - $100M+ = 22 pts | $50M+ = 19 pts | $20M+ = 15 pts
  - $10M+ = 12 pts | $5M+ = 8 pts | $1M+ = 4 pts | <$1M = 0 pts
- **Maturity proof**:
  - Scaleup/Scaling = +3 pts
  - Growth/Deploying = +2 pts
  - Validating = +1 pt

**Example**: A Series B startup with $8M raised shows clear market validation (funding validated business model, growth trajectory proven by reaching Series B). Score: 12 + 2 = 14/25.

### 2. Scalability (0-25 points)
Evaluates technical and organizational capability to scale.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Stage-based scaling potential**:
  - Scaleup/Scaling = 20 pts (already proven)
  - Growth/Deploying = 15 pts (actively scaling)
  - Validating = 8 pts (proof-of-scale)
  - Earlier = 2 pts
- **Use case breadth as platform indicator**:
  - 4+ use cases = +5 pts (platform architecture)
  - 2-3 use cases = +3 pts (some flexibility)

**Example**: A startup deployed at scale with 2 customers using similar solutions across different domains shows both scaling proof and some platform characteristics. Score: 20 + 3 = 23/25.

### 3. Innovation (0-25 points)
Evaluates AI/agentic capabilities and innovation potential.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Innovation area weighting**:
  - Topic 1 (Agentic) = 24 pts (highest AI innovation)
  - Topics 2-5 (AI-focused) = 20 pts (strong AI)
  - Topics 6-9 = 12 pts (some AI/specialty)
  - Other = 5 pts
- **Platform reusability** (use case breadth):
  - 3+ use cases = +1 pt (reusable innovation)

**Example**: An agentic platform that serves both Claims Processing and Underwriting shows Topic 1 + multiple use cases. Score: 24 + 1 = 25/25.

### 4. Financial Health (0-25 points)
Evaluates financial sustainability and runway.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Funding stage**:
  - Series D+ / Late Stage = 22 pts (sustainable)
  - Series C = 18 pts
  - Series B = 13 pts
  - Series A = 8 pts
  - Seed = 2 pts
- **Total capital raised** (sustainability indicator):
  - $100M+ = +3 pts
  - $50M+ = +2 pts

**Example**: Series B company with $9M raised shows both series progression and reasonable capital base. Score: 13 + 0 = 13/25.

### 5. Corporate Experience (0-20 points)
Evaluates B2B/enterprise readiness and successful implementation track record.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Provider status** (enterprises actively using product):
  - Currently used by enterprises = 18 pts (proven enterprise fit)
  - Not provider = 0 pts
- **Series signals enterprise readiness**:
  - Series C+ or Late Stage = +2 pts

**Example**: A Series C startup actively used by 5 insurance enterprises clearly demonstrates enterprise implementation capability. Score: 18 + 2 = 20/20.

### 6. Use Case Breadth (0-20 points)
Evaluates flexibility to address multiple AXA business needs.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Number of distinct use cases**:
  - 5+ use cases = 20 pts (comprehensive platform)
  - 4 use cases = 17 pts (very flexible)
  - 3 use cases = 14 pts (good flexibility)
  - 2 use cases = 8 pts (limited flexibility)
  - 1 use case = 3 pts (specialized)
  - 0 use cases = 0 pts

**Example**: A software development platform used for legacy system modernization, API generation, and documentation automation shows 3 distinct enterprise use cases. Score: 14/20.

### 7. Geographic Fit (0-20 points)
Evaluates EU presence and GDPR/data compliance infrastructure.

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Country/region**:
  - EU Core (DE, FR, ES, IT, NL, BE) = 20 pts (optimal)
  - EU Extended = 17 pts (good)
  - Switzerland = 19 pts (excellent data protections)
  - US/Canada = 8 pts (acceptable)
  - Asia-Pacific = 5 pts (challenging)
  - Israel = 6 pts (tech-strong but data concerns)
  - Other = 0 pts

**Example**: A French AI company benefits from both EU Core location and GDPR-first infrastructure. Score: 20/20.

### 8. Risk Penalties (0-15 points reduction)
Factors that reduce partnership viability.

**Penalty Factors**:
- **Very early stage** (prototype/idea stage) = -5 pts
- **Early validation stage** = -2 pts
- **No external funding** = -8 pts
- **Non-EU location** (beyond acceptable) = -3 pts

**Example**: A bootstrapped startup in Switzerland at prototype stage: 0 (no funding) + 5 (prototype) - 0 (Switzerland acceptable) = -5 pts total reduction.

## Scoring Formula

```
Raw Score = Market Fit + Scalability + Innovation + Financial Health 
          + Corporate Experience + Use Case Breadth + Geographic Fit
          - Risk Penalties
          
Maximum possible = 160 points

Normalized Score = (Raw Score / 160) × 100

Letter Grade = Map normalized score to A+ through F scale

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **160-Point Foundation**
Each factor (Market Fit, Scalability, etc.) has explicit point values that sum to 160. This makes scoring transparent and explainable - stakeholders can see exactly why one startup grades higher than another.

### 2. **Normalized to 100 for Familiarity**
While calculated on 160 points, scores are normalized to 0-100 then mapped to A+ through F grades. This provides both technical precision and intuitive understanding.

### 3. **EU Geographic Advantage**
AXA is headquartered in France and operates across EU. Data transfer regulations (GDPR) favor EU-based partners. Geographic scoring reflects this business reality: EU Core gets 20/20 points, US gets 8/20, Asia gets 5/20.

### 4. **Enterprise Experience = Corporate Readiness**
Being actively used by enterprises (is_provider = true) is worth 18/20 points in Corporate Experience. This assumes if a startup can implement with one enterprise, they can do it for AXA.

### 5. **Topic 1 (Agentic) = Innovation Leadership**
The highest innovation scores go to agentic platforms (Topic 1) because this represents the cutting edge of what AXA wants: autonomous agents that can handle complex business processes. Topics 2-5 (AI-focused) get 20/25. Non-AI gets much lower scores.

### 6. **No Perfect Scores**
Maximum achievable score is ~98 (not 100). This creates a realistic distribution where even exceptional startups aren't "perfect" - there's always room for improvement or risk mitigation.

### 7. **Risk Penalties Are Subtractive**
Risk factors directly reduce otherwise good scores. An early-stage startup can't earn a high grade through other factors - execution risk matters.

## Tier Mapping (Optional)

Grades automatically map to priority tiers for backward compatibility:

| Grades    | Tier | Interpretation |
|-----------|------|---|
| A+, A, A- | Tier 1: Critical Priority | Pursue actively for partnership |
| B+, B | Tier 2: High Priority | Evaluate for strategic fit |
| B-, C+ | Tier 3: Medium Priority | Monitor and engage periodically |
| C, C-, D, F | Tier 4: Low Priority | Not suitable for partnership now |

---

## Interpretation Guidelines

### For Startup Selection
- **A/A+ grades**: Ready for direct partnership talks
- **B+ / B grades**: Good fit, evaluate for specific use cases
- **B- / C+ grades**: Monitor, revisit in 12 months
- **C and below**: Not suitable for AXA partnership at this time

### For Investors/Board
- A+ startups represent ideal AXA partnerships: scaling, well-funded, EU-based, proven enterprise adoption
- A startups are nearly ideal with minor gaps
- B startups offer good value but require more AXA customization
- C startups are too early-stage or misaligned for partnership focus
- D/F startups should not be partnership priorities

### For Product Teams
- Check "geographic fit" if data compliance is concern
- Check "use case breadth" to understand flexibility for multiple business units
- Check "innovation" score (and Topic mapping) to understand AI capabilities
- Check "corporate experience" for implementation readiness

## Running a Full Evaluation

To recalculate all startup grades based on current database:

```bash
cd /home/akyo/startup_swiper

# Dry run to preview changes
python3 evaluator/recalculate_scores.py --dry-run

# Full run with verbose output to understand scoring
python3 evaluator/recalculate_scores.py --verbose

# Regular run (updates database)
python3 evaluator/recalculate_scores.py
```

---

## Notes

- Grades are deterministic - same startup will always get same grade
- Grades reflect data quality - if enrichment data is missing, grades may be lower
- Grading is performed monthly or after significant bulk enrichment
- Grades are independent of industry trends but reflect AXA's current partnership strategy
